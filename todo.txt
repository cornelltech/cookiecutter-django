Things to do to get this this repo where it is useful for the foundry.  Really we're mostly removing stuff, currently it's a little complicated.

We are generating a project that is just a basic REST api, nothing else.

- remove all static files, gulp and anything that would serve js or html files.
- try to reduce complexity where posible
- add rest framework
- add cloud formation
- posibly add circle.yml
- make docker the default
