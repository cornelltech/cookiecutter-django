Things to do to get this this repo where it is useful for the foundry.  Really we're mostly removing stuff, currently it's a little complicated.

We are generating a project that is just a basic REST api, nothing else.

- remove all static files, gulp and anything that would serve js or html files.
- try to reduce complexity where posible
- add rest framework
- add cloud formation
- posibly add circle.yml
- make docker the default
- remove whitenoise (already done from cookiecutter.json)  Let's host all static files on s3, why not?
- remove sentry (already done in cookiecutter.json)
- remove opbeat and windows
- remove   "use_heroku": "n",
- remove   "use_elasticbeanstalk_experimental": "n",
- remove   "use_compressor": "n",
- remove   "js_task_runner": ["Gulp", "Grunt", "None"],
